# 25 Oct Notes
* Note Taker: Zhengdan Li

## Undo and Auto save team:
* The simplest way to undo is by saving and loading states into files. But I feel that undo is a movement so it should be board managerâ€™s responsibility and be connected with movement controller.
* How to add a button?


## Scoreboard team:
* Created a ScoreManager class that implements calculateScore and updateScore.
* Decided the algorithm for calculating scores of Slidingtiles with three different complexities.
* Created a timer to record the time taken to finish the game.
* Q: Where to trigger calculateScore?
where to save the file containing scores?
